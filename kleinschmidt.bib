  shorttitle = {Structure in Talker Variability},
  abstract = {One of the persistent puzzles in understanding human speech perception is how listeners cope with talker variability. One thing that might help listeners is structure in talker variability: rather than varying randomly, talkers of the same gender, dialect, age, etc. tend to produce language in similar ways. Listeners are sensitive to this covariation between linguistic variation and socioindexical variables. In this paper I present new techniques based on ideal observer models to quantify (1) the amount and type of structure in talker variation (informativity of a grouping variable), and (2) how useful such structure can be for robust speech recognition in the face of talker variability (the utility of a grouping variable). I demonstrate these techniques in two phonetic domains—word-initial stop voicing and vowel identity—and show that these domains have diﬀerent amounts and types of talker variability, consistent with previous, impressionistic ﬁndings. An R package (phondisttools) accompanies this paper, and the source and data are available from osf.io/zv6e3.},

@article{Zaki2013,
abstract = {According to an influential multiple-systems model of category learning, an implicit procedural system governs the learning of information-integration category structures, whereas a rule-based system governs the learning of explicit rule-based categories. Support for this idea has come in part from demonstrations that motor interference, in the form of inconsistent mapping between response location and category labels, results in observed deficits, but only for learning information-integration category structures. In this article, we argue that this response location manipulation results in a potentially more cognitively complex task in which the feedback is difficult to interpret. In one experiment, we attempted to attenuate the cognitive complexity by providing more information in the feedback, and demonstrated that this eliminates the observed performance deficit for information-integration category structures. In a second experiment, we demonstrated similar interference of the inconsistent mapping manipulation in a rule-based category structure. We claim that task complexity, and not separate systems, might be the source of the original dissociation between performance on rule-based and information-integration tasks.},

  abstract = {Human infants have the remarkable ability to learn any human language. One proposed mechanism for this ability is distributional learning, where learners infer the underlying cluster structure from unlabeled input. Computational models of distributional learning have historically been principled but psychologically-implausible computational-level models, or ad hoc but psychologically plausible algorithmic-level models. Approximate rational models like particle ﬁlters can potentially bridge this divide, and allow principled, but psychologically plausible models of distributional learning to be speciﬁed and evaluated. As a proof of concept, I evaluate one such particle ﬁlter model, applied to learning English voicing categories from distributions of voice-onset times (VOTs). I ﬁnd that this model learns well, but behaves somewhat differently from the standard, unconstrained Gibbs sampler implementation of the underlying rational model.},
